    # Reset Pearl
    # Teleporter glitch messes pearl up and she reboots to her "original programming"
    # The MC spends the day trying to get her to remember things they've done.
    # MC gets upset and pearl defaults into giving him a handjob to calm him down.
    # Handjob moves into a blowjob, and then Pearl readies herself for the dicking of a lifetime.
    # And proceeds to set a course for Intercourse.  Upon pearl's climax she reverts back to normal,
    # not understanding what happened, only surprised that you had sex with her.

    "Pearl waves to you over by the teleport pad."

    "There's an overfull backpack sitting on the floor, a sure sign that there's a mission waiting for you."

    p "[playerName], it is good to see you so bright and early!"

    m "Yeah of course."
    m "It's crazy how much sleep I can get when I'm not cramming for exams."

    "Pearl seems unimpressed."

    p "Sleep, yes. Well anyway while you were unconcious I got a lead on some mysterious signals."

    "You give her an inquisitive look."

    m "I didn't think you guys cared about radio transmission or whatever."

    p "Well these aren't radio waves."
    p "It is a special form of light frequency modulation that I picked up while doin a cursory examination of our local spectra..."

    m "..."

    p "Er well, suffice to say, it is a transmission that might be from other gems."

    m "I remember you saying that they would be dangerous if they found our home."

    p "Yes! Which is why we have to investigate their origin."
    p "Pick up your supplies and let's head out."
    p "And make sure not to forget anything!"

    m "How long are we going out for?"

    p "A week would provide satisfactory coverage of the area of interst."

    "You go off to get some things Pearl always misses for expeditions"
    "Namely toilet paper and snacks."
    "The bag is filled with all sorts of hiking equipment though."
    "If you're going to be gone for a week, you definately need some portable gaming."

    m "Now where did my 'Battle Bastards Portable' get to..."

    "You find the errant game console, still charged into the wall."

    m "At least Amethsyt remembered to keep it charged while I was away."

    p "What's that [playerName]?"
    p "Stop fussing around over there and get this mission underway."

    "Feeling slightly hurried, you yank the game and charger from the wall promptly step to the center of the pad."

    p "Excellent! Now we can-"

    "As the energy from the teleporter charges up with a loud hum, you notice the charger touching the pad."
    "The normally bright energy beam that ferries you off appears to waver, and sparks emit from the cable."
    "The sudden sparks cause you to drop your console."
    "Apparently loose wires aren't good for highly advanced energy systems."

    "Before you can react, the two of you are whisked off by the beam."
    "A sunny sky and green field greet you."
    "Quickly, you step off and take off your backpack."

    m "Aw geez, that was scary. What do you think happened, Pearl?"

    p "-kzrt-"

    m "That can't be good."

    "Pearl looks, for lack of a better phrase, 'glitched out'."
    "You get increasingly worried as her form stuggles to maintain itself."
    "Ultimately, her body discorporates."
    "Instead of collapsing into her gem, she instead morphs into holographic clam shell."

    m "That's... new."

    "It looks like the teleporter resetting also caused Pearl to reset."
    "You only skimmed that user manual Pearl gave to you."

    "The hologram bounces gently in the air for a moment."
    "A horizontal ray of light shines out from the center of the clamshell and bathes you in light."
